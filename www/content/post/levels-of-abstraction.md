I have a half-formed thought, bouncing around in my head. It has to do with the concept of abstraction.

I've been thinking about levels of abstraction, and the concept of "zooming out." Over the last week, I spent some time working on a software application that I'm calling `terrikon`. It's a web application running, for development purposes, on a virtual machine. Now, for a variety of seemingly intractable (but probably very simple, with the right perspective) technical reasons, I haven't actually gotten the virtual machine to talk to the host machine, but it doesn't matter. What matters is the concept of a virtual machine.

A virtual machine is a machine defined only in terms of information. The device that I'm using to write this is an Apple MacBook Pro manufactured in the late aughts - it's a complex piece of glass, plastic, silicon and assorted other bits, and the commands that I'm sending to it are being enacted, at some bottom level, physically. There are physical transistors, switches, routers that get the output machine language signals, and do things like changing the state of some physical fragment of a hard drive. The point is, this very sleek notebook computer is what we usually think of as a machine.

But, the thing is that I could describe, in terms that the notebook computer understands, another machine that exists entirely in the notebook's memory. I could run a piece of virtualization software to spin up an arbitrary number of other computers, running other operating systems, that exist only temporarily, and in terms of digital memory. I could nest such systems to a depth limited only by the capacity of the host machine, which remains physical and is, in the final analysis, doing all the work manually.

The point here is that the "computer" - the thing doing the work, the kernel, the engine - is just another piece of software. I don't know much about much, but I have read that this is the defining characteristic of a von Nuemann machine, and thus of all modern computers - the concept that there is data, and there is a system to operate on that data, but that fundamentally the system is just data too.

I'm probably wrong about something in the above, but I'm not too worried about it. What's interesting to me is the link to another idea.

And here's the part where my thinking gets a bit nebulous - it has to do with political systems. There's the sense, when you learn about political science, that political systems are sort of the operating systems of societies - that they exist above and outside of things like public opinion and law. But, just as you learn eventually that there isn't a qualitative difference between software and operating systems, there also isn't a qualitative difference between a law and a political system, or even between a popular belief and a political system. These conceptual transformations have something in common - the transmutation of the hard into the soft.
