There is a useful distinction to be made between planning and doing.  Planning is important - it's good to get some perspective, to see what's coming and to make strategic course corrections.  But doing is probably more important - meditation does not move mountains, and planning is pointless without execution.

So what is the balance to seek?  Is it true that the planner should be the junior partner in terms of time?  Probably.  Giving the planner priority leads to open-ended, directionless tinkering with systems, which doesn't accomplish much.  So what can I do to spend more of my life doing, and less planning?

Ah, this is a question about guiding structure - not systems or lists but structural nudges.  Establishing the habit of working in focused pomodoros is a good one.  Let's say I set up a goal of x pomodoros per day.  I just get a little timer and crank through those x pomodoros working on whatever projects I've identified as the important ones for the week.  At the end of those pomodoros, I're done, and I can keep working or switch to something else as needed.  And that's Ir goal for the day - x pomodoros working on y projects.

This gives me something concrete to work on every day, with a clear end point.  However, it is also true that there is always more work to do, and it's easy to feel guilty about not letting work expand to fill all available space.

How does one deal with that fact?

What a lot of this is leading to, I think, is the dissolution of the hard barriers between work projects and non-work projects.  At any given time, there are any number of things I could be working on - some of them are projects given to me by my employer, and some of them are not.  Traditionally, the division of what time I work on which projects corresponds to the division of time between office and everything else.  This, however, is increasingly irrelevant - I can easily work on employer projects in places other than the office, and I can easily work on non-employer projects in the office.  The only things that really only happen in the office are things that depend on access to a particular set of servers, and face-to-face access to coworkers.  These things, generally, are fairly minor components of my work.

So what does life look like if I take this idea to its conclusion?  Well, I still pick the most important projects for the day, but without an eye to whether they are work projects or not.  I still care about meeting (and in fact beating) deadlines and expectations for work projects, but I take my time as a consolidated whole and fit projects into it as needed, in or out of the office.  I set a target of a number of pomodoros per day to complete, and I spend them working on the current important things.  When important things are done, I do housekeeping and maintenance, and knock out mosquito work.  When my pomodoros are done, the workday is over.  I review weekly, monthly and quarterly at different levels of focus, adopt continuous experimentation to find the best times and places for me to get things done, and thus keep the big picture more or less in sync with the daily work.

In times of real crisis, of course, I work as much as needed - but those should be vanishingly rare.  If crisis occurs with any frequency, it's a sign of a deeper problem.

I like this idea enough to try it for a while.  We'll see how it goes.
