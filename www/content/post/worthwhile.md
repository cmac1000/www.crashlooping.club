For the last couple of weeks, I've been studying [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). It's an interesting book, and a good introduction to some useful low-level programming concepts. Today I decided to shelf it for a while and pursue other things; my thinking was as follows:

Is the study of the SICP, at the moment, worthwhile? (Worthwhile, by the way, is a pretty good word. Is this worth the time it takes?)

So let's look at this: I am studying this computer science textbook. Looking realistically at the rate I'm going through it, finishing the whole book will almost certainly be months of work. Looking back on this project from the perspective of November or December, am I going to think it was worth the time? Particularly, compared to all the other things I could do with those hours?

It does seem like a pretty good introduction to things like stacks and compilation and other fairly low-level programming concepts that get glossed over by languages like Python and Perl. Knowing a bit about how the engine works, the theory goes, makes you a better mechanic.

At the moment, I haven't defined my goal for studying computer science more than to know that I'd rather build systems then be part of one, and one way to make that distinction appears to be programming. The field is big and fast-moving enough that there might not much of a benefit to angling myself toward a particular job, and it's worth laying a solid foundation. Maybe the way to think of this is as a side project pursued for its intellectual appeal, which may eventually have some bearing on my work, or may not.

But really, whether or not it's a good use of time depends on whether or not it ends up being useful for real work. And if I'm really going to treat this as something important enough to carve out time for, it can't be a hobby - it needs to feel more real. Within a couple weeks of studying Perl, I was writing useful applications - I used one of them this morning, to parse and regularize a list of phrases into compact xml tags. I have a hard time thinking of many real problems that I will be inclined to solve through Lisp.

Basically, it seems like this - an academic study of hydrology and pressure mechanics might help a good plumber be a slightly better one; it might even be a good training course for someone who's angling to be in charge of a building's plumbing system. But most of the time, spending some hours installing pipes and fixing problems as they arise is probably a better approach to becoming a good plumber. The SICP seems very academic, and I would rather just be building things.

What this probably actually comes down to is the distinction between computer science and programming. I want to program more than I want to be a computer scientist, so it's Python, I think, for the time being.  SICP is always there, if someday I really need to know how to write a register machine.
