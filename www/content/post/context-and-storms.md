A few weekends ago, I had an ambitious list of things I wanted to accomplish on a lovely Saturday morning.  I had a big, unbroken day with no commitments, and I was going to run roughshod over some things that had been leering at me from my to-do list for weeks.

About twenty minutes before I was going to depart, on my courageous bicycle, to vanquish these multifarious demons, the sky opened and effortlessly smashed my lovely plan with a lengthy storm.

There was a time in my life when this sort of derailment would have thrown me - I am the sort of guy naturally inclined to develop master plans, stunning in their complexity and fragility. However, I have come around to the conclusions that interruptions, postponements and unexpected wrenches should be expected, even welcomed.  A more poetic man than I might call them [dancing lessons from God](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle).

I think, actually, that this is the most valuable thing I've figured out about work and effort over the last decade or so: how to both create plans and keep track of projects in as much detail as is needed, while maintaining the willingness to toss them lightly into the dustbin of history when the world (as worlds are wont to do) changes, and flip with minimal fuss over to doing what is possible under the new circumstances.

The real problem is never external - external reality is like the weather, it just is whatever it is. If there is a disconnect between my idea of reality and my experience of reality, my idea is what needs to change.

And of course, as is generally the case when I figure something out that seems important, it's been figured out for at least [2,500 years or so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampajanna).
