When I approach the pinnacle of something, it always seems to combine the qualities of excellence and simplicity.  It's both as good as it can be, and as uncomplicated as I can get it. It's high quality, with no extraneous bits.  This, I suppose, is what you call elegance.

Elegant things are beautiful, but not in the sense of a faberg√© egg, all ornamentation and fragility. It's more the beauty of a crystalline atomic structure, based in function and fundamental strength - design by subtraction rather than addition.

This is the appeal, I think, of things like writing code in at a bare table on a frozen morning - the stark beauty of pure functionality. It's a lot of the reason Apple's products seem so much more designed than those of their competitors - Apple is relentless at removing cruft.

The best work I've ever done follows that mold - drafted, revised and honed.  Clean code, good writing, clear communication. Nothing extra. And come to think of it, the times in my life when I've felt most focused and together have also been characterized by that kind of clarity - clarity of vision, clarity of goal. The systems that have worked for me, the art that I like, the people that I admire - elegance all around.

This is one of those conclusions that I tend to come to repeatedly, and then forget about.  A good idea to write it down, and keep it in sight.
