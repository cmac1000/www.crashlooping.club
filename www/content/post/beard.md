It's cooling down, which is good news for right-thinking Americans everywhere.  As they usually do, my thoughts turn to two cold-weather projects: growing a beard and lifting heavy weights.

The idea of being a heavily muscled, beardy programmer fits pretty well with my goals in life.  I imagine myself basically as a supporting character in a William Gibson novel, wearing a knit watch cap and sipping from an enormous thermos of coffee as I tap network-penetration commands into a laptop, on a folding card table, in a cold trailer on the industrial fringes of a vast, blue-gray city.

From time to time I scowl at the passing mercenaries, and put Bach on my headphones.

Failing that, I will take being a moderately-muscled, beardy Python enthusiast wearing Gap khakis and writing office automation scripts.

Something about working on a computer, in the early morning, in cold weather, is very appealing to me.  Writing code, in silence and solitude, .  It's very like the appeal of the winter training scene in Rocky IV, bearded man pulling sleds and punching trees.

Why is that, I wonder?  I suppose for the same reason that the idea of being a yeoman farmer has appeal - the direct connection to reality, and the sloughing-off of all extraneous fluff.  Yep, that's it.

My main man C. P. Thomas once told me about a young lady he knew on the University of Florida crew team, whose otherwise-bare dorm room was furnished with a single bed and a rowing machine.  This is a similar scenario - bare essentials and productive work.
