Once in a while, when I am walking around, I suddenly get a vertiginous sense of the depth of reality.  I can usually wrap my head, at least in an abstract sense, around the scale of reality - the world is a big place, and there are a lot of people, but the orders of magnitude here are things I can think about, if not really picture.

Depth, though, is different. I few nights ago I was walking around my neighborhood, and I walked past a bush with white flowers.  It was getting dark, and the colors of the bush were fading into each other, and something about it caught my eye as I was passing.  I'm not sure why this particular bush with these particular flowers hit me so hard, but the texture and geometry of the flowers snapped into focus for me, and the bush seemed, briefly, more solid and real than anything around it - the street shrank into a background and I had a reeling sense, for a moment, of how much reality there was packed into this thing, and by extension, everything else.

It was sort of like what I imagine it would be to get a sudden sense of the distances you're dealing with when you look at the night sky.  If you could flip your perspective and get your brain to stop thinking of the stars as a curved surface projected overhead, things like astronomical distance would take on non-academic reality, and your mind would spend a few moments whirling around before it settled back down and popped, as a coping mechanism, back into dealing with comfortable abstractions.

This kind of thing is why I like science and philosophy.  The scale and scope of the ideas are of such a magnitude as to seem incomprehensible, and thus at first glance meaningless.  I still don't really have an intuitive grasp of the implications of relativity, and every time I get close to the idea my mind starts doing acrobatics.  It's the same thing that happens when I really think about consciousness, and how completely baffling it is that my mind became real, out of nothing, in Daytona Beach sometime around August 1985.

It's unfortunate that these things are hard to talk to people about; trying to think about the actual structure of reality is about the most fascinating thing I can think of, and it seems a shame to relegate it to the realm of freshman philosophy classes.  It is true, though, that it's easy to be a dilettante, to gain a Wikipedia-level understanding of a lot of things, and trot trivia out at parties; and this is no way to live.  Drilling below that surface is a sometimes-daunting task, and it's easy to get away with not doing it, but as wiser men than I have observed, all the fun parts of life are [optional](http://xkcd.com/1050/).
