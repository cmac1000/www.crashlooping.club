I read a book, once, owned by a dear former roommate.  It was written by a man who may have been British, or perhaps South African, and it was about his recommendations for constructing a self-sufficient homestead.  This, in college, was an idea that seemed very cool.  I could be a man of the earth, baking bread from grains raised from the soil, slaughtering pigs in the cold morning light and striding purposefully around my land in flannel and beard, fixing hedges and chopping wood.  I could exist in quiet harmony, growing hale and deep in a profusion of organic vegetables and timeless wisdom.

The problem with this idea is that it is almost, but not entirely, complete hogwash.  Farming with hand tools is brutally hard, endless work, and the drive, on the part of farmers and their children, to get away from it seems like a reasonably good first-pass explanation for why cities, art and technology exist.

Which is not to say that farming isn't important, or that physical work isn't valuable, or even that the organic/local food movement is hot air (although a pretty substantial proportion of it probably is).  The problem with the idea isn't really its rejection of technology, or its embrace of sustainability - the problem is its rejection of the division of labor, which is the principle that seems to undergird quite an sizable amount of human health and prosperity.  Trying to produce everything locally, for a farm, is a recipe for a lot of poorly-made things.  Trying to instill this principle more broadly in a society is a recipe for famine and economic collapse.

It's interesting that the idea is so appealing, though.  The rugged frontiersman is a very sexy idea - strong, capable, answerable to no-one.  This is the image, they say, that Americans hold of themselves, and it's why we like to buy trucks and own land and care a great deal about zoning regulations.

The thing is that this kind of life, at least in the US, seems to boil down a lot less to harvesting squash in the September sun, and a lot more to driving to Wal-Mart in the nearest strip mall.  Humans are social, and we do surprisingly well in dense, stacked urban conglomerations.  Adaptive hyper-specialization is a route more likely to lead to health and prosperity than hairshirt environmentalism.  Things like carbon emissions, oil spills and fertilizer runoff are real problems - but technology seems like it has at least as good a shot at solving them as anything else.

The sometimes-proposed alternate solution, that of stabilizing and reducing material consumption, seems like such complete balderdash to me that I have a hard time taking it seriously.  For this to work, billions of people would have to either A) Decide that they are okay with reduced or stagnant material circumstances (and also probably have many fewer children) or B) be directed to do this by their governments.  A seems unrealistic, and any scenario where B comes to pass effectively necessitates police-state tactics that would make Stalin jealous.

As much as I like fresh tomatoes, cities are the place to be.
