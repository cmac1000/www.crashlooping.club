Goals are tricky things.  I quite like making them, and then watching them sail by.  I think the trouble may be caused by a confusion on the relative merits of focusing on outcomes and outputs.

The kinds of goals I am generally inclined to come up with are goals about outcomes.  An outcome goal would be something like "cudgel 300 badgers," or in the argot of project management goons, "by January 1, 2013, 300 badgers will have been cudgeled in Westchester County" (As an aside, have you every tried to explain the verb tense construction "will have been" to a non-native English speaker?  I don't recommend it.  It's only mildly better than the hideous "was going to have been").

Good outcome goals are clear, specific and time-delimited, and I find them 99% useless.  Goals I can get my head around and do something with are almost always output goals.

An output goal is something like "spend 300 hours cudgeling badgers in Westchester County."   It works for me because I can control outputs much more than I can control outcomes: this one isn't limited by an arbitrary number of badgers, but by a real constraint of hours.  I could plan to cudgel an effectively infinite number of badgers in Westchester County - planning around a constraint focuses attention on the resources available, and forces me to make real decisions about not doing all the other things that I could do with those 300 hours.  And usually, if something is important enough to me to spend resources on, doing too much of it isn't a problem: it's important enough to get it as good as possible.  The more badgers the better.

Output goals also only work if I'm sincere about them, which makes them basically only useful to myself and a good test for whether something matters.  You set someone else an outcome goal so that you have an agreed success condition; if you are, for example, accepting bids for a cudgeling contract on behalf of the White Plains Department of Mammal Control, Melinae Division, your goal is to make sure that enough of those short-legged omnivores get bludgeoned in a reasonable time frame.  An output goal doesn't work here: contracters being notoriously tricky, one could easily spend those 300 hours cudgeling one badger, if he were to follow the timeless recommendations of the CIA's [Simple Sabotage handbook](https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2012-featured-story-archive/simple-sabotage.html).  The other side of this, of course, is that given an outcome goal his incentive is to cudgel precisely 300 badgers, and then while away the remaining hours with some tequila citrus wings at the [Lazy Boy Saloon](http://www.yelp.com/c/white-plains-ny/bars).

The point, to the extent that there is one, is that making goals for myself about outputs lets me ask the right questions about them.  The right diagnostic question, when a goal sails by, is not about allocation of resources or possible problems in the GANTT waterfall flowchart that I have constructed - it's about whether or not I actually care enough about this thing to do it.
